### Question 8

Create a Quarto report containing the 

* regional association plot
* the total number of SNPs within that plotted region
* Lead SNP
  * rsid
  * p-value
  * beta
  * standard error

* Finally include a table of the top 5 SNPs (**ranked by p-value**) and **include all columns**.

I believe an markdown woudl also be acceptable and because I do not have Quarto installed, I decided to use jupyternotebook.
